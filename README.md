# InsectDuration
Code and data used to generate results and figures of "Climate drivers of adult insect activity are conditioned by life history traits" manuscript.
If you download or clone this repository, you can fully replicate LMM and PLMM results and figures. We also release the cleaned occurrence records datasets that were used to estimate phenology metrics.

## A brief overview of what is found in each directory and subdirectory

### data
Contains data that was used to estimate phenology metrics and data used in modeling framework.

#### LMM_data
Data used in linear mixed model and phylogeneitc linear mixed modeling framework. 
phenoTraits_data.csv have all estimated phenology metrics for species with trait data.
phenoTraits_data_withNumObsData.csv has climate variables in original values instead of scaled values to figure out what 1 s.d. of a variable was equal to.
phnoTraits_data_withNumObsData.csv has number of Obs term added to dataset. Note this is the dataset used in all mixed models.
